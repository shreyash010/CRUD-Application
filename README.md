# CRUD-Application
First we have created a table Students.
This table would have four columns:

student_id: This column would store a unique identifier for each student. It is defined as an integer and is set as the primary key, which means that it must be unique for each row and cannot be NULL.

first_name and last_name: These columns would store the student's first and last names, respectively. They are both defined as variable-length character strings (VARCHAR) with a maximum length of 255 characters and are not allowed to be NULL.

grade: This column would store the student's grade level. It is defined as an integer and is not allowed to be NULL.
